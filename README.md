# Compryss
_Release V0.1_

Handles storage, compression, loading and decompression based on the _zlib_ library for python.
The storage is based on JSON files, and can therefore also be used to store, compress and load arbitrary JSON strings.

A minimal working example is provided in the module, so you can use that and the documentation to get started.
Feel free to modify the code as you see fit.
